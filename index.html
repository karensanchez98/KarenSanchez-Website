        <div class="subheading mb-5">History MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Karen Sanchez and I was born and raised in San Diego, CA. I have encountered a variety of cultures because I was born into a military family and have had to travel a lot. Therefore, since my childhood I have learned to adjust to new environments and socialize with different types of groups of people. I am passionate about aiding mental health institutions and helping children who are in the Child Protective Services. I am currently enrolled in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in History in order to develop skills that would allow me to successfully pursue a career in law. I am interested in becoming a child advocate attorney to defend and represent children in the court of law. I have volunteered at daycares and child education centers during the summertime when I am not attending school. I have found these types of volunteer opportunities to be most fulfilling because I enjoy helping children learn and make progress. I have worked many jobs that require customer service, which has helped me practice my social and professional skills. 
        <br><br>
        As a history major I continue to understand the world that we live in today. Understanding history has helped me realize why laws are in place and how they reflect our society and norms. Throughout my education, I have been able to sharpen my ability to form arguments based on evidence that is provided to me. I have also learned to think critically, outside the box, and analyze evidence with an unbiased perspective. My education in history has also provided me with the opportunity to organize large amounts of documents and decide if they are relevant to an overall topic. I mainly feel devoted to helping people in my community who are in need. Unfortunately, mental health institutions and child protective services are often underfunded and therefore corrupt. I hope to bring justice and safety to our society by representing at risk and maltreated children in the court of law. I believe that the familial environment that children are raised in plays a major role in their mental health and emotional maturity. Therefore, representing children who are under the child protective services would help ensure that each child is safe and are able to live a healthy life.
<br><br>

      I am also very passionate about music, visual art, and photography. I believe that encouraging creative and musical expression is a form of identity-development and will help establish a safe space for people. I personally play guitar and enjoy drawing/sketching in my free time. I believe that healthy relationships affect every aspect of an individualâ€™s life. So with my positive and dedicated attitude, I aspire to bring hope to children who are going through a difficult and stressful time. I hope to bring change to abused and hurt children in a system that desperately needs devoted individuals.        </p>
